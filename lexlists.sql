Within these sectors, we spotlight those lawyers, who concentrate on either contentious or non-contentious matters. Litigation includes: Copyright and contractual disputes (either representing studios, producers or talent); First Amendment litigation in the US; IP and trademark disputes; antitrust; and matters arising from film finance. On the non-contentious side, Chambers includes production; financing and distribution concerns; IP; licensing and supplementary rights planning.

You are invited to make separate submissions for as many of these categories as you wish.\n\nContact names supplied as part of submissions will not be used for any purposes other than editorial research and will be contacted without reference to the firm supplying the details. Please remember:\n- With the exception of the new domestic deal of the year category, IFLR only covers international deals with a cross-border element. \n- IFLR rewards legal innovation. We are not interested in how big, high-profile or quick the deal was.\n- Firms win team of the year categories for working on the most innovative deals, nothing else. The size of the firm, its volume of work or its recent hires are not relevant. \n- We recommend only submitting three deals per category, maximum. It is unlikely more than that stand a chance of being shortlisted. Also, we only require a brief explanation of why the deal was innovative. It is therefore possible to be very efficient and concise with submissions.\n- Rather than send lots of forms, you will notice that the documents attached are multi-purpose. Please use the attachments as templates for all your submissions.\n\nNational team awards\nNational team awards will be given to the firm with the best track record in 2013/2014 giving local-law advice on the most innovative international finance deals from the country in question. This includes debt, equity and equity-linked deals, M&A, project finance, and restructurings.\n\nComplete one of the National team award forms for each country in which you are nominating your firm.

Therefore, rather than a lifetime achievement award, this particular honor relates to professionalism in the actual practice of law. Background letters from clients, other attorneys and judges have provided a full picture for the reviewing committee in the past. Your nomination should, as inclusively as possible, specify how the nominee has demonstrated the following attributes:\n\na) Dedication to service to clients and always acting in the best interests of the client;\n\nb) Civility: behaving to all with courtesy, consideration and respect;\n\nc) Exemplary ethical conduct: endeavoring at all times to fulfill the spirit, and not just the requirements, of the NY Rules of Professional Conduct;\n\nd) Competence: keeping abreast of the latest developments in his or her area of practice;\n\ne) Good judgment: providing client service consisting of discerning opinions and advice based upon knowledge, experience, moral as well as legal considerations;\n\nf) Mentoring, educating and assisting other attorneys;\n\ng) Integrity: always exhibiting soundness of character, fidelity, honesty and fairness.\n\n\nPlease keep in mind, in considering your nomination, that there are other awards honoring service to bar associations and pro bono activities. In this Attorney Professionalism Award, the New York State Bar Association seeks to honor a person who exemplifies the highest standards of professionalism in the actual practice of law.

Being the “first” or “largest” or “cheapest” of a given type of project will be noted but will not be the weightiest criterion. Whether large or small, the winning project will need to demonstrate achievement in technology and service that is worthy of being considered a best practice.\nAble to demonstrate material results from at least six months of operation prior to the nomination deadline. No planned or in-progress projects, please. (We realize that all true smart grid projects are works in progress, but we are looking for projects with a defined scope that have been completed, monitored, and reported on.) For example, specify costs saved by end users, outages averted that would not previously have been avoided, dispatchable or controllable small-scale distributed generation resources added to the grid in such a way that they strengthen the grid rather than destabilize it, or some other metric(s) that illustrate the substantive benefits enjoyed by one or (preferably) more grid stakeholders.', 0, 0, 'Company; Organization; Law Firm', NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL, 4212, '', '', NULL, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '0000-00-00 00:00:00'),

If your plant has distinguished itself by innovative design or engineering upgrades, producing power more reliably or economically than comparable plants, or demonstrating a new generation or environmental controls technology, don’t miss the opportunity to see your plant profiled in POWER. We also offer an award for a noteworthy smart grid project and plant water-related project.\n\nAward winners will be selected by the editors of POWER based on nominations submitted by you and your industry peers—suppliers, designers, constructors, and operators of power plants. Don’t be shy about nominating your plant; most of our past winners were nominated by plant staff. If your project is selected as an award finalist, a POWER editor will contact you to develop an article that will be published in POWER to inform the rest of the industry of your achievement. Additionally, all winners will be mailed an award that displays their project’s name on a custom POWER cover. Water Award\n\nIntroduced in 2014, the Water Award goes to a water-related project at a power plant anywhere in the world that demonstrates leadership in the management of water and/or wastewater streams. Winning projects will have successfully implemented innovative, leading-edge approaches to water stewardship, water quality, water availability, or wastewater-handling issues. Although technology may be involved, the award is not specifically for a new commercially available technology. Rather, the award recognizes creative problem-solving that results in water management strategies that may serve as models for other plants.
